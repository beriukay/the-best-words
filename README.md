# the-best-words
To help everybody know words, and have the best words.

Republican frontrunner Donald Trump once said*: "I went to an Ivy League school. I'm very highly educated. I know words, I have the best words, but there's no better word than 'stupid'."
This has led many to furiously debate: what exactly are "The Best Words"?

Now, thanks to the power of regular expressions, and a few reasonable assumptions, we have that answer.
