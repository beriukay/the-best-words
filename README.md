# The Best Words
To help everybody know words, and have the best words.

Republican frontrunner Donald Trump once said*: "I went to an Ivy League school. I'm very highly educated. I know words, I have the best words, but there's no better word than 'stupid'."
This has led many to furiously debate: what exactly are "The Best Words"?

Now, thanks to the power of regular expressions, and a few reasonable assumptions, we have that answer. What are these assumptions? Well... "stupid" HAS to be included in the list, if we are to take that quote in the given context, where he can think of no better word than "stupid" for people he once called "incompetent". To include the letters 's' and 'i', it must be the case that Trump includes the full spelling of the word "Senior", thus the name must be "Donald John Trump Senior". Another reasonable assumption is that we are ignoring case.
